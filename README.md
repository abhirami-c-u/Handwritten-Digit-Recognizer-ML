#  Handwritten Digit Recognizer using CNN

This is my **first Machine Learning project** as a beginner! It's a simple and fun **digit recognition system** that uses a trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model and a **Tkinter GUI** where you can draw any digit (0–9), and the model will predict it!

## Features

-  Draw digits using your mouse
-  Model predicts digits (0–9) in real-time
-  Built using a trained CNN on the **MNIST dataset**
-  Clean and simple **Tkinter-based GUI**
-  Trained model saved and loaded using Keras

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tkinter (GUI library)

---

## Dataset

- [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)  
  Contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits:
  - 60,000 for training  
  - 10,000 for testing
